        <h2>Why Elastic Neck Bandanas?</h2>
        <p>
            Our bandanas slide gently over your dog's head with a soft elastic neck.
            No tying, no buckles, and no dangling knots. Just comfy, secure cuteness that
            stays put whether you’re on a walk, at a game, or at the farmers market.

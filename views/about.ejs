    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
        It all started with a dog who loved attention and a kid who loved crafts.
        Courtney, our young entrepreneur, wanted a way to dress up her pup without fiddling with
        complicated buckles and knots. The result was our elastic, slip-on bandanas.
    </p>
    <p>
        From there, the idea grew into matching hair scrunchies for humans, seasonal prints,
        sports themes, and a booth at local markets around Northern Virginia.
